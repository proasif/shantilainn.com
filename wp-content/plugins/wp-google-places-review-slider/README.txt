Brand new plugin! Easily create a slider to display your Google Places business reviews in your Posts, Pages, and Widget areas!

== Description ==

A great way to boost your customer confidence and increase SEO! You work hard for your 5 star business Google reviews, now you can easily display them on your WordPress site! Put your Google reviews in a slider (or responsive grid) in your widget areas or directly on the post! Google limits the number of reviews you can pull from them to 5, but unlike similar plugins, this one can automatically check for new Google reviews every day and add them! 

Feature List:

* Create a really cool slider. Sort of like an image slider, but with your Google Places reviews.
* Not in to sliders? Then display Google reviews in a responsive grid or list.
* Choose to display only high rating reviews.
* Download your Google Places reviews and save them in your database.
* Create multiple templates to use on your Posts, Pages, & Widget areas.
* Display the Google reviews using a shortcode, template function, or use a widget.
* Template display options like: show/hide star rating, show/hide date, border radius, background and text colors.
* Choose how many Google Places reviews to display per a row and even have multiple rows.
* Sort them by date or show them randomly.
* Use custom CSS if you like.
* Hide Google reviews that do not include text.

This plugin uses the Google Places API to get your reviews. The API only returns the 5 most helpful reviews. When Google changes the 5 most helpful the plugin will automatically add the new one to your database. Thus slowly building up a database of reviews. The Pro version allows you to manually add other Google reviews.
